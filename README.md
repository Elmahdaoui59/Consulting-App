### Introduction: 
--------------------
A training project build as part of a course about Firebase on Android:  User Email Authentication and Verification. on pluralsight.
this is my version of of the app Mitch tabian build on Pluralsight course on 2018, Except I'm writting it on Jetpack Compose and I'm using new android tecnologies as: 
# dependenct injection.
# flows to update UI state and retrieve events.
# Couroutines.
# clean architecture with data, domain and presentation layers with use cases.

I'm still folowing on the next courses about firebase products as firestore and and cloud messaging, so I'll still continue push my update here.
for now the three screens I've build are here, one for authentication(registration and signIn), one for account setting and the other as main screen the user see after signing in.
